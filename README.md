2) A game project. This approach also uses DOM manipulation but includes heavier logic implementation and more programming. If you choose this approach, the webpage must:

Have minimum one HTML page.
Show instructions for the user.
Include a very simple game, like the one you coded last week (Guess what number I am thinking).
Allow the user to perform some interaction, like clicks or input filling, that results in losing or winning. For instance, you could program a game like Wordle, a Memory Game, a quick-click game, etc.
Include the use of at least one setInterval or setTimeout, even if it is to show an alert.
